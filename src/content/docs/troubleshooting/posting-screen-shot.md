### A screen shot can help to explain details of a problem.

<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
  <li>
    To create a screen shot of your entire desktop, press the "Ctrl-PrtScn" buttons on your
    keyboard.&nbsp; This will capture an image of your screen to your PC memory.&nbsp; Then
    launch some graphics program such as "MSPaint" (comes with all Windows O/S) and paste
    the captured image into "MSPaint".&nbsp; That file may then be saved as a .jpg or .png
    image to be posted.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>A better alternative</b> - To create a screen shot of a single window, dialog box,
    error message, etc., select the window to make that window have focus.&nbsp; Then press
    the "Alt-PrtScn" buttons to capture the image to your PC memory.&nbsp; Paste the
    captured image into "MSPaint" and save the file as a .jpg or .png image to be posted.
  </li>
</ul>
<br />

### Follow these steps to attach the screen shot to your post in the Forum:

<ol class="list-decimal pl-8">
  <li>In your thread, click Full Editor button under the quick reply box.</li>
  <li>
    Locate Filename and Browse buttons, click and navigate to the screen shot you just
    saved.
  </li>
  <li>Click Add File and Submit. Your file will be attached to your post.</li>
  <li>
    You can make the screen shot visible in the post by adding attachment tag with the file
    name you saved <b>[attachment=1]FILE.NAME[/attachment]</b>. If you attach more than one
    file, refer to each one with its number: attachment=1, attachment=2... .
  </li>
</ol>
<br />

Alternatively, you may post the image file you saved to a public server like
[Imgur](http://imgur.com/) or some other free image hosting website. Visit their sites for more
details on how to get link to the image to post in the forum.
