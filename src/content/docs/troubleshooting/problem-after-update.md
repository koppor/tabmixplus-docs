Sometimes people complain about a Tab Mix Plus development version (or a release) being
incompatible. You are welcome to try other,
[older builds](https://github.com/onemen/TabMixPlus/releases/) but keep in mind that Tab Mix Plus is
always compatible and always working, even with Beta, Aurora and Nightly, despite Firefox
incompatibility warning you might be seeing.

Although older version may work for you without a problem it is very important that you report about
any problem.

The problem you encounter can be incompatibility with other extensions or a bug in Tab Mix Plus that
only reveals itself in a specific Firefox and Extensions combination. Installing old version will
not fix the problem.

If you haven't read [How to post about a problem](../how-to-post), read it now.

If you are testing pre-release Firefox versions, you really should install Disable Add-ons
Compatibility Check, Add-on Compatibility Reporter, or simply
[search AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=Compatibility) for something
similar, there's a whole bunch available now. While it may not eliminate the warning, it will allow
you to install and use add-ons with pre-release Firefox versions.

Remember to always use the latest development version available with latest Firefox pre-release
versions, let it be Beta, Aurora or Nightly.
