title: Preferences won't save

Sometimes your Tab Mix Plus options fail to be saved after you change them. For example, you may
change a setting in the Tab Mix Plus Options window only to have it set back to its previous value
when you reopen the Options window or restart Firefox.

Read [this article](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Preferences%20are%20not%20saved) from
Mozilla support for possible fix.

If you still have trouble keeping preferences from getting reset, try to temporarily disable your
other extensions one at a time (restart Firefox after each extension you disable) until the problem
disappears.

Report to our forum if after you disable specific extension the problem disappeared.
