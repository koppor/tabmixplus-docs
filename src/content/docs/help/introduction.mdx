Tab Mix Plus is a very popular extension for the Mozilla Firefox&reg; browser that enhances
Firefox's&reg; tab browsing abilities. It includes such features as duplicating tabs, controlling
tab focus, tab clicking options, undo closed tabs and windows, plus much more. It also includes a
Session Manager with crash recovery that can save and restore combinations of opened tabs and
windows.

Tab Mix Plus comes with Options window that includes all of its preferences as well as adding user
interface to important Firefox hidden preferences. It is recommended that you make all change to the
preference in the options window. The options window is available from the Add-ons Manager or from
the Tools menu (unless you turn this option off).

bar and "extensions.tabmix" in the filter box to narrow down the results from the search.
