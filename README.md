# Tab Mix Plus - Docs

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

This repository build with Astro + Starlight to generate `Github pages` for `Tab Mix Plus - Docs`

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed
as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.
