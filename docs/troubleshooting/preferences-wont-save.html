        Sometimes your Tab Mix Plus options fail to be saved after you change them. For
        example, you may change a setting in the Tab Mix Plus Options window only to have it set
        back to its previous value when you reopen the Options window or restart Firefox.

        Read <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Preferences%20are%20not%20saved">
        this article</a> from Mozilla support for possible fix.

        If you still have trouble keeping preferences from getting reset, try to
        temporarily disable your other extensions one at a time (restart Firefox after
        each extension you disable) until the problem disappears.

        Report to our forum if after you disable specific extension the problem disappeared.
