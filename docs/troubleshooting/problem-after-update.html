          Sometimes people complain about a Tab Mix Plus development version (or a release) being
          incompatible. You are welcome to try other,
          <a href="https://github.com/onemen/TabMixPlus/releases/"> older builds</a> but keep in
          mind that Tab Mix Plus is always compatible and always working, even with Beta, Aurora and
          Nightly, despite Firefox incompatibility warning you might be seeing.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Although older version may work for you without a problem it is very important that you
          report about any problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem you encounter can be incompatibility with other extensions or a bug in Tab Mix
          Plus that only reveals itself in a specific Firefox and Extensions combination. Installing
          old version will not fix the problem.

        <p>
          If you are testing pre-release Firefox versions, you really should install Disable Add-ons
          Compatibility Check, Add-on Compatibility Reporter, or simply
          <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=Compatibility"> search AMO</a>
          for something similar, there's a whole bunch available now. While it may not eliminate the
          warning, it will allow you to install and use add-ons with pre-release Firefox versions.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Remember to always use the latest development version available with latest Firefox
          pre-release versions, let it be Beta, Aurora or Nightly.
