---

Most issues reported in Tab Mix Plus forum usually end up to be extensions or theme conflicts.

When posting, please, always include your OS (Operating System),
[Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox) and Tab Mix Plus versions. A list of
your extensions could also be useful as somebody might spot a troublesome extension which can lead
to a faster resolution.

You can set your OS, Firefox and Tab Mix Plus information in the
signature field in your profile (link to the User Control Panel is at the top of every page of the
Forum). This way, you will not have to type it every time. Just remember to update it with Firefox
and/or Tab Mix Plus update!

It is very helpful if you can post the steps to reproduce your
problem and if you experience an issue with a specific page, include a link(-s).

### Save Browser Console log

The Browser Console is a tool provided by Firefox to log errors, warnings and messages for all
content tabs, for add-ons, and for the browser's own code.

The content of the Browser Console can provide important information about your problem. To get this
information, open the Browser Console (Tools &gt; Web Developer &gt; Browser console) when you
encounter the problem you want to report about, right click anywhere in the console and click select
all. Copy everything and paste it to a text file.

If your problem happens when Firefox starts, open the Browser Console immediately after Firefox
starts and copy/paste its content to a text file, then clear the content and open new window and
copy/paste the Browser Console content to another file.
