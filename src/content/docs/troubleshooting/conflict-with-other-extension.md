If the Error button in the Tab Mix Plus Options is visible, some of your extensions are
incompatible with Tab Mix Plus. It is recommended you disable or uninstall the extensions
in the list. Click the "Show Listâ€¦" button to do that.

Conflicts have been reported with <b>Ubuntu Firefox Modifications</b>
extension, so if you use Ubuntu, disable that one (you can read
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=826536">more here</a>).

Conflicts with **BarTab**, **Colorful Tabs** and **Tree Style Tab**
have been reported. Since all these extensions manipulate tabs, shouldn't be surprising.
Don't panic, these conflicts are usually solved rather quickly, especially if good
information is given (like errors in console, screenshots, steps to recreate, etc.). Feel
free to post and provide as much info as possible.
